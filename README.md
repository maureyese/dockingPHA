# Molecular Docking and Dynamics for E.COLLIPHA project

This repository corresponds to one of the three computational biology analyses of the E.COLLIPHA project in the GOGEC Competition of 2026.

> **Objective**: Identify the potential mechanical properties of PHA as a polymer in medical sutures for wound healing.

We worked using VS Code, along with the WSL extension (Ubuntu 22.04) as our development environment (Only-windows users).

1. WSL Installation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
2. VS Code Installation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows#_install-vs-code-on-windows
3. WSL extension on VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl

_(The following activities may not be ordered exactly as described in the final written report delivered in the competition)_

## Activity 1: Docking of PHA oligomer with skin and immune proteins

- PHA oligomer
- Multiple confomers
- Ensemble docking

## Activity 2: Dynamics of PHA polymer stability under different lengths

_(under development...)_

## Activity 3: Mechanical and structural properties of PHA polymer

- LAMMPS
